    <h2>Challenge: The Programmer's Riddle</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're exploring an ancient digital labyrinth. To escape, you need to input a code sequence into the central computer. You find a clue carved on the wall:</p>
    <p><strong>8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 7, 6, 3, 2, 0</strong></p>
    <p>But there's a catch: The sequence is not what it seems. To find the correct next number, you must uncover the hidden pattern. Here's a hint to guide you on your quest:</p>
    <p><strong>Hint:</strong> The order is determined not by mathematics, but by a property inherent to each number.</p>
